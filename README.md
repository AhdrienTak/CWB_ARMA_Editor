# CWB_ARMA_Editor
Coders Without Borders ARMA Object Editor

In Unity3D, select ARMAObjectTransformer_Standalone as a project folder to open.
After doing so, open the test scene and run the program (or build it for Windows/Mac).
   Remember to add the test scene to the build.

Login credentials can be found on the Web Server under /Credentials.
Valid usernames are the titles of the text files in the Credentials directory (minus the leading underscores).
Valid passwords are in the text documents themselves.
I would list usernames and passwords here, but this is a public-viewable readme, so I'd rather not.

The other folder, ARMATestStuff, contains a couple of models and images to test the Editor with.
The editor will open a native file browser that works on both Mac and Windows; if you don't have any
.obj or image files laying around, you can use the stuff in ARMATestStuff.

This version of the build does not have any AR Preview demo capabilities

When Editing, click on "Translate" or "Rotate" to move the camera around.
When Translating:
   Hold Left-Click and drag to move the camera around.
   Hold Right-Click and drag to move the camera forward and backward.
   Scroll the mouse wheel to move the camera forward and backward.
When Rotating:
   Hold Left-Click and drag to swivel the camera around.

Notes:
When saving large files, it may take a second for the program to respond (so if it looks like it froze, give it a second or two).
Likewise, when modifying an object you were working on, it has to dwonload all of its assets from the Web Server, this could also take a second.
Any image file you save to the Web Server (Texture and Marker) are NOT viewable, (they are not .jpg and .png files like they say they are!).
